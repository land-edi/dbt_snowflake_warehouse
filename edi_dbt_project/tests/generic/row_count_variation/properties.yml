    description: 
      Test the row count variation of a model by comparing percentage of change from previous value to a defined threshold.
    documentation:
      This macro allows you to test the row count variation of a model by comparing the percentage of change from previous value values within a specified time range. 
      It is useful for monitoring changes in data volume over time. The parameters are
      - the time granularity (`HOUR`, `DAY`, `WEEK`, `MONTH`, `YEAR` with default `DAY`)
      - the window of time to look back (default is 7)
      - the threshold for variation (default is 15)
      It is either set at a timestamp/date column level of a model or at the model level if the model has a timestamp/date column named `event_timestamp`
      ```
        tests:
          - row_count_variation:
              granularity: DAY
              window: 7
              threshold: 15
      ```
